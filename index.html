	      			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Teaching Platform</h2>
	      			<p>AIET adopts student centric approach in its pedagogic practices such as<br>
					<b>Class-room learning :</b> Teachers deliver lectures using multi-media such as PPTs, Videos, and Recorded Lectures and also, use case study analysis to improve classroom dynamics.  They strictly adhere to the University prescribed syllabus and norms in conducting classes, examinations, evaluations and assessments.   Curriculum gaps addressed through technical talks, workshops, seminars and conferences.  Presently, the classes are being conducted on-line on Impartus Platform, Google Classroom, Moodle depending on the comfort and convenience of the learner and the teacher.<br><br>
					To enhance learning potential of students innovative techniques are adopted such as- <br>
					<b>Cross-over learning :</b> Learning in informal settings, such as experiential learning in companies,  working in research oriented organizations and after-class clubs, can connect educational content with issues that matter to learners in their academic pursuits. These connected experiences have found to spark further interest and motivation to learn.<br><br>
					<b>Learning through argumentation :</b> Teachers encourage students to ask open-ended questions, participate in discussions, look for answers from authoritative secondary sources and learn from experts.<br><br>
					<b>Incidental learning :</b> AIET provides plenty of opportunities for students to organize interdepartmental and inter-collegiate activities. Unplanned or unintentional learning occurs while planning, organizing and carrying out an activity that is seemingly unrelated to what is learned.<br><br>
					<b>Learning by doing :</b> AIET encourages and guides the students to take part in mini-projects, Seminars, Internships, Certification courses, Student development programs (SDP) in the trending fields of technology, enhancing their career prospects. There is an innovation lab where students are encouraged to incubate startups.  Management and faculty are always there to support student initiatives.<br><br>

					<b>Mentor/Mentee Program</b> <br>
					Among the best practices adopted by AIET Mentor, the Mentee System has proved highly effective.  Each lecturer is assigned as a mentor for students to guide them in their studies and help them to become familiar with the Institute culture.  The Mentor meets the mentees on a regular basis. All papers concerning the mentees are available with the Mentors for quick reference and facilitation.
